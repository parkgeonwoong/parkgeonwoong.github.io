  만나서 반갑습니다.  
  <mark>프론트엔드 엔지니어</mark>로 일하고 있는 **박건웅**입니다.  
  저의 개발 목표는 모든것을 분석하고 해체하는 것입니다. 그리하여 점진적으로 누구나 그대로 읽고 이해할 수 있는 코드를 보고 아름다움을 느끼게 하는 것입니다.

          During my time at Harvard I learnt most of my key skills that have I have taken through my career such as teamwork and working to tight deadlines. I thouroughly enjoyed my time as university and learnt a lot about a healthy work life balance.

          I spent a lot of my free time as a committee member of the *Harvard Mountaineering Club* taking on roles such as *Trip Secretary* and *Vice-President*.
